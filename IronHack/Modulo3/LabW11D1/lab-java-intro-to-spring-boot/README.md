  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">I am stuck and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start. What should I do?</summary>

  <br> <!-- ✅ -->

  If you are stuck in your code and don't know how to solve the problem or where to start, you should take a step back and try to form a clear, straight forward question about the specific issue you are facing. The process you will go through while trying to define this question, will help you narrow down the problem and come up with potential solutions.

  For example, are you facing a problem because you don't understand the concept or are you receiving an error message that you don't know how to fix? It is usually helpful to try to state the problem as clearly as possible, including any error messages you are receiving. This can help you communicate the issue to others and potentially get help from classmates or online resources.

  Once you have a clear understanding of the problem, you should be able to start working toward the solution.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">How do I create a Spring boot project?</summary>

  <br> <!-- ✅ -->

  Spring boot is a framework for creating stand-alone, production-grade applications that are easy to launch and run. The best way to create a Spring boot project is to use the Spring Initializer website. The website provides a convenient way to generate a basic project structure with all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

  - Step 1: Go to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/)
  - Step 2: Choose the type of project you want to create, such as Maven or Gradle.
  - Step 3: Select the version of Spring Boot you want to use.
  - Step 4: Choose the dependencies you need for your project. Some common dependencies include web, jpa and data-jpa.
  - Step 5: Click the "Generate" button to download the project files.

  Alternatively, you can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. These IDEs have plugins for creating Spring boot projects, making it easy to set up the environment and get started with coding.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is JPA and how can I use it in Java?</summary>

  <br> <!-- ✅ -->

JPA stands for Java Persistence API, which is a Java specification for accessing, persisting and managing data between Java objects and a relational database. JPA provides a standard interface for accessing databases, reducing the need for custom data access code and enabling efficient management of database connections.

To use JPA in Java, you will need to include the necessary dependencies in your project, such as the Hibernate JPA implementation and create entity classes to represent your data. These entity classes will be annotated with JPA-specific annotations, such as `@Entity` and `@Id`, to indicate the mapping between the Java class and the database table.

Here is a code snippet to show you how to create a JPA entity class in Java:

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
   @Id
   @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.IDENTITY)
   private int id;

   private String name;
   private int age;
   private String position;

   // Getters and Setters for the attributes
}
```

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is the purpose of using the "@Entity", "@Table" and "@Column" annotations in JPA (Java Persistence API)?</summary>

  <br> <!-- ✅ -->

  The `@Entity`, `@Table` and `@Column` annotations in JPA (Java Persistence API) are used to map Java objects to relational database tables.

  `@Entity` is used to mark a class as a persistent entity. This means that instances of the class can be stored in a database.

  `@Table` is used to define the name of the database table that the entity will be mapped to.

  `@Column` is used to define the columns in the table that correspond to the attributes of the entity.

  Here is an example of how to use these annotations:

  ```java
  @Entity
  @Table(name="employee")
  public class Employee {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
    @Column(name="id")
    private int id;

    @Column(name="first_name")
    private String firstName;

    @Column(name="last_name")
    private String lastName;

    //getters and setters
  }
  ```

  In this example, the `Employee` class is marked as a persistent entity using the `@Entity` annotation. The name of the database table is defined using the `@Table` annotation as "employee". The `id`, `firstName` and `lastName` attributes are mapped to columns in the "employee" table using the `@Column` annotation.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is the purpose of using the "@RestController", "@GetMapping" and "@ResponseStatus" annotations in Java for building a RESTful web service?</summary>

  <br> <!-- ✅ -->

  The `@RestController` annotation is used in Java to define a class as a RESTful web service controller. This annotation allows the class to handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses.

  The `@GetMapping` annotation is used to map a specific HTTP GET request to a method in a controller class. This allows the method to handle the request and return a response.

  The `@ResponseStatus` annotation is used to set the HTTP status code for the response returned by a method in a controller class.

  Here's a code snippet showing how to use these annotations in Java:

  ```java
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseStatus;
  import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;
  import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;

  @RestController
  public class ExampleController {

    @GetMapping("/example")
    @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)
    public String exampleMethod() {
      return "This is a response from a RESTful web service";
    }
  }
  ```

  In this example, the `ExampleController` class is defined as a RESTful web service controller using the `@RestController` annotation. The `exampleMethod` is mapped to a specific HTTP GET request using the `@GetMapping("/example")` annotation and the HTTP status code for the response is set to `HTTP 200 OK` using the `@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.OK)` annotation.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is the purpose of "@JsonIgnore" in Java and how is it used?</summary>

  <br> <!-- ✅ -->

  The `@JsonIgnore` annotation is used in Jackson (a popular library for JSON processing) to ignore a property when serializing or deserializing an object to/from JSON. This means that when the object is converted to JSON, the property marked with `@JsonIgnore` will not be included in the JSON representation.

  The `@JsonIgnore` annotation is applied to a property in a Java class to ignore it during JSON serialization or deserialization. For example, consider a class named Employee with a property named "password". To ignore the "password" property, we can annotate it with `@JsonIgnore`:

  ```java
  public class Employee {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    @JsonIgnore
    private String password;

    // getters and setters for the properties
  }
  ```

  When this class is serialized to JSON, the "password" property will not be included in the JSON representation.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What is "JpaRepository" and how can I use it in Java?</summary>

  <br> <!-- ✅ -->

  `JpaRepository` is a Spring Data interface that extends the `PagingAndSortingRepository` interface. It provides all the basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations and additional methods to work with **JPA (Java Persistence API)** to interact with the database.

  To use `JpaRepository` in your project, follow the below steps:

  Step 1: Import the necessary libraries

  ```java
  import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
  ```

  Step 2: Create an interface that extends `JpaRepository`

  ```java
  public interface MyRepository extends JpaRepository<MyEntity, Long> {

  }
  ```

  **Note**: In the above code, `MyEntity` is the entity class that you want to interact with the database and Long is the type of the primary key of `MyEntity`.

  Step 3: Inject the interface in the class where you want to use it.

  ```java
  @Autowired
  private MyRepository myRepository;
  ```

  Step 4: You can now use the methods provided by `JpaRepository` to interact with the database, for example:

  ```java
  MyEntity myEntity = new MyEntity();
  myRepository.save(myEntity);
  ```

  With the above steps, you can now use `JpaRepository` to interact with the database in your Java project.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">What are derived query methods in JPA and how do I use them in Java?</summary>

  <br> <!-- ✅ -->

  Derived query methods in JPA are methods in a JPA repository that are automatically generated by the framework based on method names. These methods allow developers to perform common database operations such as finding entities based on specific criteria, sorting, pagination and more, without having to manually write the corresponding SQL query.

  To use derived query methods in Java with JPA, follow these steps:

  1. Create a JPA repository interface: To start, create an interface that extends `JpaRepository` and specifies the entity class and the primary key data type. For example:

    ```java
    import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
    import org.example.domain.User;

    public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Long> {
    }
    ```

   2. Define the method name: Next, you can define the method name based on the query you want to perform. There are several conventions that JPA follows to determine the query to be executed, such as keywords such as `findBy`, `readBy`, `queryBy`, `countBy` and `deleteBy`, followed by the name of the entity’s properties. For example, to find all users with a specific first name, you can define the method name as follows:

    ```java
    List<User> findByFirstName(String firstName);
    ```

   3. Inject the repository: Finally, you can inject the repository into your service or component class and call the methods to perform the query operations.

    ```java
    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public List<User> getUsersByFirstName(String firstName) {
      return userRepository.findByFirstName(firstName);
    }
    ```

  **Note**: The exact implementation of derived query methods may vary depending on the JPA implementation you are using (e.g., Hibernate, EclipseLink, etc.). However, the basic concept of using method names to generate queries remains the same.

  <summary style="font-size: 16px; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-weight: bold;">How can I use the JPA annotations "@OneToOne", "@OneToMany", "@ManyToOne", "@ManyToMany", "@JoinColumn" and "@JoinTable" in Java?</summary>

  <br> <!-- ✅ -->

  The Java Persistence API (JPA) provides several annotations for mapping relationships between entities in Java applications. These annotations include:

  1. **@OneToOne**: This annotation is used to define a one-to-one relationship between two entities. The following code shows how to use the `@OneToOne` annotation:

   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Employee {

     @Id
     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
     private Long id;

     private String name;

     @OneToOne(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
     @JoinColumn(name = "address_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
     private Address address;

     // Getters and setters ...
   }

   @Entity
   public class Address {

     @Id
     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
     private Long id;

     private String street;

     private String city;

     // Getters and setters ...
   }
   ```

  2. **@OneToMany & @ManyToOne**: These annotations are used to define one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between two entities.

   The following code shows how to use the `@OneToMany` and the `@ManyToOne` annotation:

   ```java
   @Entity
   public class Department {

     @Id
     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
     private Long id;

     private String name;

     @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
     private List<Employee> employees;

     // Getters and setters ...
   }

   @Entity
   public class Employee {

     @Id
     @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
     private Long id;

     private String name;

     @ManyToOne
     @JoinColumn(name = "department_id", referencedColumnName = "id")
     private Department department;

     // Getters and setters ...
   }
   ```

  3. **@ManyToMany & @JoinColumn & @JoinTable**: The `@ManyToMany` annotation is used in Java to define a many-to-many relationship between two entities. This means that multiple instances of one entity can be related to multiple instances of another entity.

   The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used in Java to specify the foreign key column that will be used to join the two entities. The foreign key column is used to establish a relationship between the entities.

   The `@JoinTable` annotation is used in Java to define a join table for a many-to-many relationship. The join table is used to store the relationship information between the two entities.

   The following code shows how to use the `@ManyToMany`, `@JoinColumn` and `@JoinTable` annotations:

   ```java
   @Entity
   public class User {

       @ManyToMany
       @JoinTable(name = "user_role",
       joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "user_id"),
       inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name = "role_id"))
       private List<Role> roles;

   }

   @Entity
   public class Role {

       @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "roles")
       private List<User> users;

   }
   ```
